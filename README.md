#Another script? Seriously??
wp-config-wordmove.php it's a simple script that which uses the data of Movefile (config file of [Wordmove](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove)) for generate the wp-config of the other host.  
Uh and can also upload it on ftp on the choosen host!

##Requirements

* PHP-CLI
* YAML (`pecl install yaml`)

##Syntax

`wp-config-wordmove.php [local|staging|production|etc] [ftp]`

The first parameter it's needed for generate the wp-config by Movefile.  
With the second parameter upload the file generated via ftp to the host.
